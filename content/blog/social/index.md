## The Flower That Smiles Today 

**[The Flower That Smiles Today](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45133/mutability-the-flower-that-smiles-to-day), in summary, is a poem about the brevity of all things â€“ all hopes, desires, and delights the world has to offer are short-lived and doomed to die. Everything is fleeting and transitory.**
